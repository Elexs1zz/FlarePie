**FlarePie**

Flarepie is an open-sourced rocket engine calculator that helps both engineers and amateurs in designing and analyzing the performance of a rocket engine. It gives the user immediate, exact calculation of the main parameters,
such as thrust, fuel efficiency, and other important performance metrics for easy comparison with the objective, hence optimizing through ease of simulation. With custom options, Flarepie is a good tool for novice to advanced/ beginner designers or hobbyists in rocket propulsion

Getting Started

1. **How to clone**
2. 
    git clone https://github.com/Elexs1zz/FlarePie.git
    cd FlarePie

3. Flarepie uses critical parameters like thrust, velocity,torque etc. along with enchaned equations, This way users can evaluate their design performances.
